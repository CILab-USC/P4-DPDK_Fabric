    "Figure 1 shows the main control block portion of a P4 program [<a href=\"#References\">3,4</a>]. Two actions are defined, ```drop``` and ```forward```. The ```drop``` action (lines 6 - 8) invokes the ```drop_packet``` function, causing the packet to be dropped. The ```forward``` action (lines 9 - 12) accepts as input (action data) the destination MAC address and port. These parameters are inserted by the control plane and updated in the packet during the ingress processing. In line 10, the P4 program assigns the egress port defined by the control plane as an input to the ```send_to_port``` extern function. It is used to direct a packet to a specified network port. Line 11 assigns the destination MAC address passed as a parameter to the packet's new destination address. Lines 13-23 implement a table named ```forwarding_lpm```. The table matches the destination IP address using the LPM type. The actions associated with the table are ```forward``` and ```drop```. The default action invoked when there is a miss is the drop action. The maximum number of entries is defined by the programmer (i.e., 1024 entries, see line 21). The control block starts executing from the apply statement (see lines 24-28) which contains the control logic. In this program, the ```forwarding_lpm``` table is activated in case the incoming packet has a valid IPv4 header.\n",
